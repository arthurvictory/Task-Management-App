# Task Management App
Welcome to my Task Mangement App! here you will see React and Typescript with some Auth0 to see how a Task Management App can be made.

## How to Install
Copy all files from the repository to your local drive and go to the folder where you downloaded the files and goto a terminal and type in 'npm run dev' to execute the program

## How to use the Task Management App
The app is small and simple basically login with Auth0 to setup your account with the task management app. Once logged in it will take you to the main dashboard of the app.
Here you will in the input field type in your task you need to do. It will add it all to a list and you can mark it completed and delete the task. If you accidentally press completed you can also click undo to put it back as uncompleted.
